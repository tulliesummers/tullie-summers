<p>Expected Release July 24th 2025</p>
          Miami was meant to be a clean break for me.
But nothing douses the thrill of a new beginning like old grief.
No money. No past. No real planâ€”just my camera, a dream and too much baggage.
I didnâ€™t expect to find a new best friend in a free fall of her own. And I definitely didnâ€™t expect Blakeâ€” the tall, annoyingly lovable drummer with eyes that seem to see everything Iâ€™m trying to run away from.
Falling for him? Absolutely not on my to-do list.
But neither was ever speaking to my brother again.

        <h3>Unpretty Things</h3>
        <p>Expected Release: August 24th 2015</p>
        <p>
          Moving out was not a well-thought-out decision.
But I needed out. Out from under my stifling mother. Out of my comfort zone. Out of that haunted house where I lost my brother. 
His death was my wake up call and Iâ€™ll be damned if I donâ€™t answer. 
I might be spiralingâ€” but who cares? Sometimes, the downfall is fun. 
Especially when you find someone worth free-falling with.
